# Selenium-File-Downloader
Use selenium to automate google chrome and click/download several hundred files


My brother needed help dowwnloading several hundred ROM's from the website listed below. 
The ROM's cover several dozen arcade cabinets and includes several thousand individual files.

The files are all stored in HTML links that the user can click, and the file begins to download automatically into the browers preferred download directory. 

Rather than click several hundred links manually, the python script clicks the links sequentially.
